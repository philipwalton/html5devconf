Web Components and the future of CSS
====================================

The slides and demos from my [dotCSS talk](https://www.dotcss.io) on Dec. 2, 2016.

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, `cd` into the `2016-12-02` directory and run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
npm install

# Build the demo files and start up a local server.
npm start
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:8080/2016-12-02](http://localhost:8000/2016-12-02) and view the slides.

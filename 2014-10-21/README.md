How Web Components will change CSS best practices
=================================================

The slides and demos from my [HTML5DevConf talk](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/philip_walton.html#session) on Oct. 21, 2014.

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, `cd` into the `2014-10-21` directory and run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
bower install

# Start up a local server.
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:8000/2014-10-21](http://localhost:8000/2014-10-21) and view the slides.

## Demos

Once you have the server running, you can view the demos by navigating to [localhost:8000/2014-10-21/demos](http://localhost:8000/2014-10-21/demos).

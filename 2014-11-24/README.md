Web Components and the future of CSS
====================================

The slides and demos from my [SFHTML5 talk](http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/204366882/) on Nov. 24, 2014.

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, `cd` into the `2014-11-24` directory and run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
bower install

# Start up a local server.
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:8000/2014-11-24](http://localhost:8000/2014-11-24) and view the slides.

## Demos

Once you have the server running, you can view the demos by navigating to [localhost:8000/2014-11-24/demos](http://localhost:8000/2014-11-24/demos).
